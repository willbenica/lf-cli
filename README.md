# lf-CLI

A command line tool to get data from the [leadfeeder API](https://docs.leadfeeder.com/api/#introduction). This data is returned in JSON format and this tool paris well with `jq` for discovery.

The leadfeeder API offers various endpoints, however this tool only gets data from:

* Leads: e.g. `https://api.leadfeeder.com/accounts/<account_id>/leads?start_date=<date>&end_date=<date>`
* Visits: e.g. `GET https://api.leadfeeder.com/accounts/<account_id>/visits?start_date=<date>&end_date=<date>`

When called from the CLI, you have the choice to either get only one page and print to standard out, or get all leads which will make multiple calls (if necessary) and save the response in a file(s).

## Installation:

Below are the steps to install (tested only with MacOS BigSur)
